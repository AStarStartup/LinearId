## LinearId.LiveCoding

### Description

This is an open-source live coding session for LinearId: Generates monotonic unique IDs blazing fast; faster than UUID and ULID; for use with React, Next.JS, Vue, PlanetScale and other sharded databases and web frameworks. This project is part of the AStarStartup open-source organization on GitHub, which is primarily written in TypeScript/JavaScript React, Next.JS, Markdown, and Chrome Extensions. This is a temporary video that will be compressed into a timelapse code mission review, so subscribe and come back to see the finished product. You can find this issue ticket at
